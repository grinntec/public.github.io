# Script: show-file/script.sh
#
# Purpose:
#   - Used by the 'show-file' composite GitHub Action to print and output information
#     about a specified .tfvars file.
#   - Outputs the file path and its directory for traceability in CI/CD workflows.
#   - Optionally writes a summary for the Actions UI.
#
# How it works:
#   - Takes the tfvars file path as the first argument.
#   - Validates input and checks file existence.
#   - Sets outputs for downstream steps.
#   - Adds a Markdown summary for easy inspection in the Actions UI.
#
# Best Practices:
#   - Do not print secrets or sensitive values from tfvars files.
#   - Use outputs for modular workflows.

# Print a GitHub Actions 'notice' or 'warning' to the workflow log.
