# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is an automation platform built into GitHub that enables you to create, run, and manage workflows directly in your repository. It allows you to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code, as well as managing issues and pull requests. Workflows are defined using YAML files and can be triggered by events like pushes, pull requests, or on a schedule, making it easy to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for your projects.
