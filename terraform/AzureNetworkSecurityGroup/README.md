# exampleTerraform-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup
This is a Terraform configuration file written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) that uses the Azure provider to create and configure a network security group (NSG) with rules in Azure.

The code begins by declaring the Azure provider and its version requirements, followed by a definition for the provider configuration.

The configuration also defines a local variable called `nsg_rules` which reads a CSV file containing NSG rules specified by the `nsg_ruleset` variable. The CSV file is decoded using the csvdecode function, and the replace function is used to remove any byte-order mark (BOM) character that may be present at the beginning of the file.

Next, the configuration creates an Azure resource group, followed by a network security group within that resource group. The NSG is given a name of `nsg-example`.

Finally, the configuration creates NSG rules based on the contents of the CSV file specified by `nsg_ruleset`. The for_each meta-argument is used to create one rule per row in the CSV file. Each rule is defined by the properties in the resource block, including its priority, direction, source and destination port and IP address ranges, protocol, and access. The values for these properties are obtained from the corresponding columns in the CSV file using the `each.value` syntax. The name of each rule is constructed from its priority and direction, and a description can also be provided.

Overall, this configuration creates a network security group with rules in Azure that can be maintained and modified by updating the CSV file.

## How to edit and create the NSG ruleset
This Terraform code relies on a CSV being imported to manage the ruleset. Terraform is very sensitive to errors, so it's ultra-important that the CSV file is true and correct. There is an Excel macro file that can aid in the creation of the CSV file. The file is called `nsg.editor.xlsm`. To use this file simply open it in Excel and edit the `EditRules` worksheet as described below. To generate the CSV version of the ruleset use the button on the worksheet named `Export Rules` which will output your data into CSV UTF-8 format and ask you to save the file. I suggest you keep both the macro and CSV files in the working directory as the Terraform code is looking for a file in the working directory and you'll likely need to add/remove NSG rules again in the future which will need the macro file. The rules you create in the macro file stay there as a record of what you have created.

### Each value in the Excel CSV described

|Column Header                              |Description                
|---                                        |---

|direction                                  |(Required) The direction specifies if rule will be evaluated on incoming or outgoing traffic. Possible values are Inbound and Outbound.
|source_address_prefix                      |(Optional) CIDR or source IP range or * to match any IP. Tags such as ‘VirtualNetwork’, ‘AzureLoadBalancer’ and ‘Internet’ can also be used. This is required if source_address_prefixes is not specified.
|source_address_prefixes                    |(Optional) List of source address prefixes. Tags may not be used. This is required if source_address_prefix is not specified.

Besides, it also supports all available Service Tags like ‘Sql.WestEurope‘, ‘Storage.EastUS‘, etc. You can list the available service tags with the CLI: shell az network list-service-tags --location westcentralus. For further information please see Azure CLI - az network list-service-tags. This is required if destination_address_prefixes is not specified.
|destination_address_prefixes               |(Optional) List of destination address prefixes. Tags may not be used. This is required if destination_address_prefix is not specified.

|destination_port_range                     |(Optional) Destination Port or Range. Integer or range between 0 and 65535 or * to match any. This is required if destination_port_ranges is not specified.
|destination_port_ranges                    |(Optional) List of destination ports or port ranges. This is required if destination_port_range is not specified
|protocol                                   |(Required) Network protocol this rule applies to. Possible values include Tcp, Udp, Icmp, Esp, Ah or * (which matches all).
